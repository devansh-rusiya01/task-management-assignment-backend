Role-Based Task Management Backend
This is the backend implementation for a Role-Based Task Management Web Application built using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).
The system facilitates hierarchical task assignment within teams, supporting host-member relationships, weekly task assignments, and secure user authentication & authorization.

Features
âœ… Authentication & Authorization

Secure JWT-based authentication system
Role-based access control supporting two user roles:
Host (Admin): Full privileges
Team Member: Restricted, view-only privileges
Passwords securely hashed using bcryptjs
âœ… User Management (Host Privileges)

Host can create, view, and delete team member accounts
Host dashboard to manage all users and their tasks
âœ… Task Management System

Hosts can:
Create, assign, edit, delete tasks
Assign tasks to specific team members
Set attributes: description, deadline, status
Team Members:
View only their own assigned tasks for the current week
âœ… Weekly Task Organization & Tracking

Tasks organized on a weekly basis
Clear visibility of current week's assignments
Track task completion & status updates by Host

Security Measures
JWT Authentication for secure sessions
Password Hashing with bcryptjs
Role-based Middleware for strict access control
Input Validation & Sanitization
Scalability Considerations
Modular MVC structure for ease of maintenance
Scalable MongoDB database schema
Middleware-based role verification for future role expansion
API routes easily extendable for new features (e.g., notifications, reporting)
